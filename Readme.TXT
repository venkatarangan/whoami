			4) Windows Directory,
			5) Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) using WinSock

Note:
----
1) Its convenient to create a shortcut for this program and put it in the desktop, next to the Network Neighbourhood Icon.

2) When you have pressed cancel in the login dialog box of Windows '9x, the program  will report that it cannot find the user name. This is the default behaviour Windows '9x  and has nothing to do with the program.
