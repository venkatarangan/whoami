# WhoAmI

## Overview
This is a traditional Win32 application, written in C, that displays the currently logged-in user, the PC name, and the duration of the login session.

This program was crafted almost thirty years ago, serving as a straightforward example of a Win32 application developed in C. The Microsoft Visual Studio compiler available at that time was used for its creation.

The source code, readme files, and Visual Studio project files have been preserved in their original state, serving as a digital time capsule. These files may not be necessary for recompilation. Please note that I have not recompiled the program since its original creation; the binaries you have are from that same period.

The FQDN was added following a request from Mr.Ranganathan, Texas, USA.

Note:
----
1) Its convenient to create a shortcut for this program and put it in the desktop, next to the Network Neighbourhood Icon.

2) When you have pressed cancel in the login dialog box of Windows '9x, the program  will report that it cannot find the user name. This is the default behaviour Windows '9x  and has nothing to do with the program.

## Testing Environment
On 25th May 2024, I ran the executable (whoami3.exe) in Windows 11 and it ran fine, shows the stability of targetting native Win32 runtime!
